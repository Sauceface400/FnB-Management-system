# FnB-Management-system

This project is an assignment for the Client-Server Computing subject at MSU (Management Science University). The F&amp;B Management System is designed to streamline and manage the operations of a food and beverage business.

**Key Features:**
- **Customer Management:** Stores and manages customer details, including contact information and order history.
- **Product Management:** Keeps track of products available for sale, including their descriptions, prices, and quantities.
- **Item Management:** Organizes individual items and their details, ensuring accurate inventory and sales tracking.
- **Inventory Management:** Monitors and manages stock levels, helping to maintain optimal inventory and reduce shortages or overstock situations.

**How It Works:**
- **User Interaction:** Users interact with the system through a web interface, where they can add, edit, or delete information related to customers, products, items, and inventory.
- **Data Handling:** The system processes user inputs and updates the database accordingly. For example, adding a new product or updating inventory levels is reflected in real-time.
- **Database Integration:** The system uses a MySQL database to store all data. Servlets handle the data processing and communication between the web interface and the database.
- **Web Interface:** The user-friendly interface allows for easy management of all aspects of the business, including product listings and inventory levels.

This system aims to provide an efficient and user-friendly interface for managing essential aspects of a food and beverage operation.
